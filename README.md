<h1>Remotely deploy the script : </h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure as Code (IaC):</strong> Traditional setups require manual configurations, which can be error-prone and inconsistent. With IaC, we codify our infrastructure, ensuring consistency across deployments and minimizing human errors.</li>
        <li><strong>Userdata in AWS:</strong> AWS allows for <code>userdata</code> to be passed to EC2 instances upon their creation. This script, when used as part of that <code>userdata</code>, ensures that our Windows machines start up with the correct configurations every time, right out of the box.</li>
        <li><strong>PowerShell:</strong> Windows' native scripting language, PowerShell, offers a rich suite of capabilities. By embedding PowerShell commands within our deployment strategy, we leverage its full potential, ensuring our Windows environments are tailored precisely to our needs.</li>
    </ol>


<p>By leveraging these utilities, WinRM management becomes a breeze, and your environment gains enhanced security, efficiency, and consistency.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> While these utilities simplify WinRM management, remember to review and adjust configurations before deploying them in a production environment. Security and specific requirements may vary, so always ensure that settings are aligned with your organization's standards.</p>
